        <div class="Anc">1. Ancient Japan</div>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Ancient Japan</b> has made unique contributions to world culture
             which include the Shinto religion and its architecture,
             distinctive art objects such as haniwa figurines, the oldest pottery vessels in the world, 
             the largest wooden buildings anywhere at their time of construction, 
             and many literary classics including the world's first novel.
              Although Japan was significantly influenced by China and Korea, 
              the islands were never subject to foreign political control 
              and so were free to select those ideas which appealed to them, 
              adapt them how they wished, and to continue with their indigenous cultural 
              practices to create a unique approach to government, religion, and the arts. </p>

        <div style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center ; font-weight: bold;">2. Classical Japan</div>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">The culture of Japan <em>during the classical Japanese period</em> . <em>The classic period of Japan began in the late 8th century,</em> and the Heian period saw the archipelago transformed in four centuries. The last division of classic Japanese history is the Heian period which ran from 794 to 1185. The Heian period was followed by the Nara Period. In 794 C.E., Japan moved its capital to Heian-Kyo from Nara 794 C.E. 
            This was the Japanese period when it first distinguished itself from the imported Chinese culture. The culture of Japan, which was established during the Heian, was enduring. Culture and literature flourished during this period. The architecture of the Heian period followed the Chinese model.</p>

        <div style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">3. Feudal Japan</div>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 23px; text-align: center;"><dfn>Feudal Japan</dfn> lasted from the years 1185 AD to 1603 AD. During this period in Japan’s history,
             the shoguns held more power in society than the emperor and the imperial court. 
             In the feudal society, the shoguns handed out land to their loyal followers and these estates were then overseen by different stewards and constables. 
             Japan was not the only country to operate under a feudal system, but theirs was different to the feudalism in Europe. 
             Whilst, to begin with, the jito (territory stewards) and shugo (military constables) did not have any land of their own, 
             they began to gain power over time and, in doing so, became huge landowners. 
             The jito and shugo also began to have their own private armies and became capable of challenging the shogunate governments. 
            This system of feudalism broke down as the jito and shugo gained more and more power.</p>

        <div class="modern">4. Early Modern Japan (year 1600's and 1868's)</div>
        <br>
        <p class="fort">Early modern Japan, or the period between 1600 and 1868, witnessed the birth of many of Japan’s most enduring cultural and political attributes, as well as the expansion of its basic geographic boundaries. For our purposes, the characterization of this period as ‘early modern’ is important because it bridges the historical chasm that usually separates the ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ realms of Japan’s historical development. Once the three unifiers had completed the military and political labours of uniting the realm, 
            Japan developed in a manner that propelled it into the modern age.
            Japan’s mid-nineteenth-century entry into the modern period was not exclusively the result of its adoption of 
            Western civilization after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, but also the result of forces pushing from within. 
            These forces caused indigenous changes, such as early forms of capitalism, increasing political centralization, 
            development of science and technology, and the gradual emergence of early nationalism. 
            These developments conspired with the importation of Western institutions and cultures to make Japan a rising 
            Asian power in the late nineteenth century. The implications of identifying an early modern period in Japan are profound. 
            They suggest commonalities in human histories, ones that transcend striking cultural variations. 
            That is, as different from Europeans as Japanese had become over the centuries, with their blackened teeth and chonmage (shaven pate) 
            hairstyles, they also developed in a manner that paralleled societies around the globe.</p>

                Hideyoshi's land survey of the 1590s designated all who cultivated the land as commoners, an act which granted effective freedom to most of Japan's slaves.
                
                Social structure of the Edo period
                The Tokugawa shogunate rigidified long-existent class divisions, placing most of the population into a Neo-Confucian hierarchy of four occupations, with the ruling elite at the top, followed by the peasants who made up 80% of the population, then artisans, and merchants at the bottom. Court nobles,clerics, outcasts, entertainers, and workers of the licensed quarters fell outside this structure.Different legal codes applied to different classes, marriage between classes was prohibited, and towns were subdivided into different class areas. The social stratification had little bearing on economic conditions: many samurai lived in poverty and the wealth of the merchant class grew throughout the period as the commercial economy developed and urbanization grew. The Edo-era social power structure proved untenable and gave way following the Meiji Restoration to one in which commercial power played an increasingly significant political role.
                Although all social classes were legally abolished at the start of the Meiji period, income inequality greatly increased. New economic class divisions were formed between capitalist business owners who formed the new middle class, small shopkeepers of the old middle class, the working class in factories, rural landlords, and tenant farmers. The great disparities of income between the classes dissipated during and after World War II, eventually declining to levels that were among the lowest in the industrialized world.Some postwar surveys indicated that up to 90% of Japanese self-identified as being middle class.
                
                Populations of workers in professions considered unclean, such as leatherworkers and those who handled the dead, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries into hereditary outcast communities. These people, later called burakumin, fell outside the Edo-period class structure and suffered discrimination that lasted after the class system was abolished. Though activism has improved the social conditions of those from burakumin backgrounds, discrimination in employment and education has lingered into the 21st century.</p>
