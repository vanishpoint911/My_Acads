  <h1>How to use command Line to Push to GitHub</h1>

  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p class="pap">Before we dive within how to use commands in GitHub<br>
  <br>
  We should talk about what is Github<br>
  </p>
  <div class="githubb"><b>GitHub</b> is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.</div>

  <br>
  <hr class="hori">
  <br>
  <div> Step 1: </div>
  <h2>* Creating a new repository</h2>
  <pre class="stepwan">    You need to create a new repository and click on the plus sign.
    
    Fill up all the required details, i.e., repository name, description and also make the repository public this time as it is free.
    </pre>




    <div> Step 2:</div>
    <h2>Open your Git Bash</h2>

    <pre class="hori2"> Git Bash can be downloaded in here, and it is a shell used to interface with the operating system which follows the UNIX command.</pre>
    <br>

    <div> Step 3:</div>

    <h2>Create your local project in your desktop directed towards a current working directory</h2>

    <div class="hori3"> <b>*pwd</b> stands for 'print working directory', which is used to print the current directory.</div>
    <br>
    <p class="hori4">Move to the specific path in your local computer by cd 'path_name'. The cd commands stand for 'change directory' and it is used to change to the working directory in your operating system, and to locate your file, 'path_name', i.e., <b>C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/FaceDetect-master </b> needs to be given. This command can identify the required file that you are looking to work with.</p>

    <br>



    <div>Step 4:</div>

    <h2>Initialize the git repository</h2>

    <p class="hori5">Use <b>git init</b> to initialize the repository. It is used to create a new empty repository or directory consisting of files' with the hidden directory. '.git' is created at the top level of your project, which places all of the revision information in one place.</p>
    <br>

    <div>Step 5:</div>
    <h2>Add the file to the new local repository</h2>
    <p class="hori6"><b>*Use git add .</b> in your bash to add all the files to the given folder.<br>
    <br>
    <b>*Use git status</b> in your bash to view all the files which are going to be staged to the first commit.</p>
      <br>



    
    <div>Step 6:</div>
    <br>
    <h2>Commit the files staged in your local repository by writing a commit message</h2>
    <p class="hori7">*You can create a commit message by git commit -m 'your message', which adds the change to the local repository.<br>
    <br>
    <b>*git commit uses '-m'</b> as a flag for a message to set the commits with the content where the full description is included, and a message is written in an imperative sentence up to 50 characters long and defining "what was changed", and "why was the change made".</p>
  

    <br>
    <div>Step 7:</div>
  
    <h2>Copy your remote repository's URL from GitHub</h2>
    <p class="hori8"> The HTTPS or URL is copied from the given GitHub account, which is the place of the remote repository.</p>
